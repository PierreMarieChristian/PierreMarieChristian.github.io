I originally hold a marine engineering diploma. So, why am I making a blog about data analysis and software engineering? Well, first of all, who knows, I might write about thermodynamics one day ? The thing is, I am as passionate about mechanical engineering as I am for coding. To build a robot, a drone, or a car, you need both  actuators and a logic board to help it navigate the world. However, as I learned everything by myself, my approach of IT and software related topics is not conventional. I made this blog to remember what I learned and maybe it will be useful to others.
